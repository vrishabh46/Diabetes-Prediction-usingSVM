# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction System using SVM

This project is a **web-based Diabetes Prediction System** developed using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model. It takes user inputs such as health metrics and predicts whether the person is likely to have diabetes. The model is trained using the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** and deployed with a simple and interactive frontend.

## Features

- Machine Learning model built using **SVM**.
- Clean and user-friendly **web interface**.
- Input fields for:
  - Pregnancies
  - Glucose Level
  - Blood Pressure
  - Skin Thickness
  - Insulin
  - BMI
  - Diabetes Pedigree Function
  - Age
- Real-time prediction result (Diabetic / Non-Diabetic).

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Joblib)
- **Machine Learning**: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Web Framework**: Flask / Streamlit *(mention whichever you used)*
- **HTML/CSS/Bootstrap** *(if applicable)*
